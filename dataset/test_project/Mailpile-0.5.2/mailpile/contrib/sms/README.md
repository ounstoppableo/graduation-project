SMS
===

A plugin to allow people to send SMS messages from their Mailpiles using 3rd party services (Twilio, Tropo, etc...)

Interested in helping develop this? See this [Github Issue](https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/issues/268)

#### Dependencies

For US based numbers, Twilio is an excellent service that handles sending & receiving of SMS messages via a REST API. 

twilio_sms.py is a simple test that sends messages once you hav the twilio dependency installed via pip or other methods

[Twilio Python SDK](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python)

`$ pip install twilio`

*Twilio is free to test out once you create an account, but costs $0.01 per SMS message you send/receive*
