# Executive summary

The script `repackage-linux.sh` can rebuild the Mailpile installer for
Windows.  Run it, yay!

... or read on to learn about bits and pieces.


## Building the environment

The environment is currently a hodge-podge of things.  This will become
more polished and move towards a proper build setup over time.

Currently we are pulling binaries from the following locations:

   - http://www.python.org/
   - http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
   - https://www.mailpile.is/files/build/

The files on www.mailpile.is either come from the other sources, or have
been built by us using PIP under Windows.
